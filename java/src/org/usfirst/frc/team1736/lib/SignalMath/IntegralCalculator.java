/**
 * Class which implements various calculations of the integral of a signal over time. Useful for
 * aproximating distance traveled from an accelerometer, or pose angle from a gyroscope, or in an I
 * term in a PID, or anything else really! <br>
 * <br>
 *
 * The integral of a signal is pretty much just the sum of all previous values. There is some
 * scaling dependant on how far apart those previous values were. With digital signals, it gets a
 * bit more interesting because there's different things you can assume about what the value of the
 * signal does between your known sample points. Often a rectangular or trapezoidal fit works great,
 * although for lower sample rates other methods can get you further. this class implements many of
 * these. <br>
 * <br>
 *
 * For the math-savvy, Wikipedia has a decent description of the various
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration" target="_blank">numerical
 * integration</a> methods this class implements for real-time. <br>
 * <br>

     * Initalizes everything needed for an integral calculation.

     * This is the stage where you, the user, must select how to do the integration. There are 5
     * methods available (named 0-4). As the number increases, so does the accuracy. However, so
     * does the time- and memory-complexity of the calculation. Choose the lowest number that suits
     * your appliaction needs. <br>

     * Integration Methods Available: <br>
     * <br>
     * 0: <i>Rectangular rule</i> Assumes the signal maintains the exact same value from the
     * previous sample to this sample, and then has a step change on the new sample.
     * "Sample and hold" is often used to refer to this assumption. <br>
     * <br>
     * 1: <i>Trapezoidal rule</i> Assumes the signal linearlly ramps between sample points. <br>
     * <br>
     * 2: <i>Simpson's rule</i> Assumes the signal acts like a 2nd-degree polynomial between points.
     * Calculations are done by integrating a second degree polynomial splined between the 3 most
     * recent samples. <br>
     * <br>
     * 3: <i>Simpson's 3/8ths rule</i> Same as Simpson's rule, but presumes a 3rd degree polynomial.
     * <br>
     * <br>
     * 4: <i>Boole's rule</i> Same as Simpson's rule, but presumes a 4th degree polynomial <br>

     * <br>
     * If you need more accuracy than this, you may wish to consider a faster sample rate.
