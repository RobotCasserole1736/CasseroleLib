/**
 * Class which implements various calculations of the integral of a signal over time.
 *  Useful for aproximating distance traveled from an accelerometer, or pose angle from
 *  a gyroscope, or in an I term in a PID, or anything else really! <br><br>
 *
 * The integral of a signal is pretty much just the sum of all previous values. There 
 *  is some scaling dependant on how far apart those previous values were. With digital
 *  signals, it gets a bit more interesting because there's different things you can assume
 *  about what the value of the signal does between your known sample points. Often a rectangular
 *  or trapezoidal fit works great, although for lower sample rates other methods can get you further.
 *  this class implements many of these. <br><br>
 *
 * For the math-savvy, Wikipedia has a decent description of the various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration" target="_blank">numerical integration</a> methods
 *  this class implements for real-time. <br><br>

     * Initalizes everything needed for an integral calculation.
	 *  
	 * This is the stage where you, the user, must select how to do the integration. There are 5 methods
	 *  available (named 0-4). As the number increases, so does the accuracy. However, so does the time- and
	 *  memory-complexity of the calculation. Choose the lowest number that suits your appliaction needs.
	 * <br><br>
	 * <br><br>
	 * Integration Methods Available:
	 * <br><br>
	 * 0: <i>Rectangular rule</i> Assumes the signal maintains the exact same value from the previous sample to this sample, 
	 *    and then has a step change on the new sample. "Sample and hold" is often used to refer to this assumption.
	 * <br><br>
	 * 1: <i>Trapezoidal rule</i> Assumes the signal linearlly ramps between sample points.
	 * <br><br>
	 * 2: <i>Simpson's rule</i> Assumes the signal acts like a 2nd-degree polynomial between points. Calculations are done by integrating
	 *     a second degree polynomial splined between the 3 most recent samples.
	 * <br><br>
	 * 3: <i>Simpson's 3/8ths rule</i> Same as Simpson's rule, but presumes a 3rd degree polynomial.
	 * <br><br>
	 * 4: <i>Boole's rule</i> Same as Simpson's rule, but presumes a 4th degree polynomial
	 * <br><br><br><br>
	 * If you need more accuracy than this, you may wish to consider a faster sample rate.
