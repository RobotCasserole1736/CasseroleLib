/**
 * DESCRIPTION: <br>
 * Single Calibration. Describes a piece of data which is usually constant, but can be overridden by
 * a cal wrangler from a csv file on the RIO's filesystem. This enables a software team to control
 * what a pit crew has control over (Shooter speed is a good candidate. Port number for left
 * drivetrain motor A is a bad candidate). <br>
 * <br>
 * USAGE:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instantiate the calibration with a default value, and reference to the wrangler</li>
 * <li>At runtime, use the get() method to read the calibrated value. The returned value may change
 * depending on what the wrangler has overwritten.</li>
 * </ol>

     * <br>

     * if the value changes (ex: update and reset PID tune values). The acknowledgement makes sure

     * cal updater and the code that cares are in different theads. Ah well. The redeeming
     * characteristic of this case is the cal values <i>hopefully</i> won't change too fast, because
     * they're human entered. This <i>should</i> mean that we always see the cycle of
     * change-process-acknowledge cleanly, but if we don't, well.... hmmm... let's just cross our
     * fingers for now. <br>
