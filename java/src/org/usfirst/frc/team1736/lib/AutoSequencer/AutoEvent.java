/**
 * AutoEvent is the abstract class which all things put onto the robot autonomous timeline must implement. For example,
 * A path-planned motion profile is one type of event. Rotating in place, closed loop around a gyro is another type of event.
 * Raising an arm is another type of event.
 * <br><br>
 * Events are fundamentally two types - parent events and child events. Parent events are the primary ones run by the sequencer.
 * Any event that is added directly to the sequencer is a parent event. These events will be run in order, each one starting 
 * as soon as the previous one declares it is finished.
 * <br><br> 
 * Child events are assigned to a parent event. While a parent event is running, each child event is evaluated individually
 * to see if it is triggered (needs to start running) or stopped (needs to stop running). As soon as a child event reports
 * it is triggered, at least once call to the child event's update() method is guaranteed. The child event will no longer be run
 * once it declares itself as "done". 
 * <br><br>
 * All events on the timeline must implement the functions defined here. User Init is for performing all user-specific actions
 * during sequencer setup. User update is the periodic update function which the sequencer will call as long as the event is active.
 * isDone() signals the sequencer this event no longer needs to run, while isTriggered() is used for child events to signal they need to be
 * run. Calculation of triggered/done conditions shoudl be performed within those methods. Do not rely upon update() to be called to evaluate
 * those conditions. Finally, the forceStop method is required to be implemented - ordinarily, the event should return the robot to a safe state
 * before declaring itself done. However, if the autonomous sequence is interrupted before the event has a chance to finish naturally, this function
 * will be called to shut down the event properly. This means doing things like stopping motors or resetting counters, whatever floats your boat (safely).
